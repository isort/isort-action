## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A [problem matcher](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/problem-matchers.md) so you can see issues without trawling through logs

## [1.1.0] - 2022-11-04

- All inputs changed to use kebab-case: `isort-version`, `sort-paths`, and
  `requirements-files`. The old camelCase arguments will continue to work for
  backward compatibility.
- [Internal] Usage of `set-output` updated to reflect [deprecation](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-11-github-actions-deprecating-save-state-and-set-output-commands/)

- Include pip install output in the log outputs instead of suppressing it.

### Fixed
